    "# Food Classification with CNN - Building a Restaurant Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment focuses on developing a deep learning-based food classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). You will build a model that can recognize different food categories and use it to return the food preferences of a user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Implement CNNs for image classification\n",
    "- Work with real-world food image datasets\n",
    "- Build a preference-detector system\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background: AI-Powered Food Preference Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "The system's core idea is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Users upload 10 photos of dishes they enjoy\n",
    "2. Your CNN classifies these images into the 91 categories\n",
    "3. Based on these categories, the system returns the user's taste profile\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to develop the core computer vision component that will power this detection engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a training (\"train\" folder) and a test (\"test\" folder) dataset which have ~45k and ~22k samples respectively. For each one of the 91 classes there is a subdirectory containing the images of the respective class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Requirements\n",
    "- Implement your own pytorch CNN architecture for food image classification\n",
    "- Use only the provided training dataset split for training\n",
    "- Train the network from scratch ; No pretrained weights can be used\n",
    "- Report test-accuracy after every epoch\n",
    "- Report all hyperparameters of final model\n",
    "- Use a fixed seed and do not use any CUDA-features that break reproducibility\n",
    "- Use Pytorch 2.6\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables\n",
    "1. Jupyter Notebook with CNN implementation, training code etc.\n",
    "2. README file\n",
    "3. Report (max 3 pages)\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your report, README and all code files as a single zip file named GROUP_[number]_NC2425_PA. The names and IDs of the group components must be mentioned in the README.\n",
    "Do not include the dataset in your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Correct CNN implementation, training runs on the uni DSLab computers according to the README.MD instructions without ANY exceptions on the DSLab machines: 3pt\n",
    "2. Perfect 1:1 reproducibility on DSLab machines: 1pt\n",
    "3. Very clear github-repo-style README.MD with instructions for running the code: 1pt\n",
    "4. Report: 1pt\n",
    "5. Model test performance on test-set: interpolated from 30-80% test-accuracy: 0-3pt\n",
    "6. Pick 10 random pictures of the test set to simulate a user uploading images and report which categories occur how often in these: 1pt\n",
    "7. Bonus point: use an LLM (API) to generate short description / profile of preferences of the simulated user\n",
    "\n",
    "**If there is anything unclear about this assignment please post your question in the Brightspace discussions forum or send an email**\n"
